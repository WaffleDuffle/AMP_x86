# Microprocessor_Architecture_-x86-

 ## <ins>Purpose</ins>
> The purpose of this laboratory is to understand how x86 architecture works, how `data / memory / commands` are used and organised in a `CPU` and more using assembly language
>
> The main program I use for analysis is `emu8086`, and x86 emulator

> Unzip the archive avaiable in this repo and install `emu8086` in order to run asm code
